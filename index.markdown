**Prerequisites**: A [GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) is needed before a GitHub Pages site can be created. [Basic Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) knowledge is needed for coding.

# Create a GitHub repository
A repository is a hosting location where README files as Markdown will store your content to host as a work portfolio.
1. Select **Your account** icon on the top right and choose **Your repositories**.
2. Select **New**.
3. Type *your_GitHub_username.github.io* under **Repository name**.
4. Select **Public**.
**Note**: A public repository is visible to anyone on the internet. Private is only visible to you and others you share with. Private repositories will impact GitHub Pages visibility as it will be unpublished and does not work with free accounts. You can change the repository from private to public anytime.
5. Select **Add a README file** checkbox.
6. Select **Create repository**.
