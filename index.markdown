# Create a GitHub repository
A repository is a hosting location where README files as Markdown will store your content to host as a work portfolio.
1. Select **Your account** icon on the top right and choose **Your repositories**.
2. Select **New**.
3. Type *your_GitHub_username.github.io* under **Repository name**.
4. Select **Public**.

 **Note**: A public repository is visible to anyone on the internet. Private is only visible to you and others you share with. Private repositories will impact GitHub Pages visibility as it will be unpublished and does not work with free accounts. You can change the repository from private to public anytime.

5. Select **Add a README file** checkbox.
6. Select **Create repository**.

# Create a GitHub Pages site
**Disclaimer**: GitHub Pages creation and content changes can take several minutes to process. If you do not see your site link or see a 404-error message when visiting your GitHub Pages site, please wait for it to finish updating and try again.
1. Select **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Code and automation** on the left and select **Pages**.
3. Under **GitHub Pages** select **Visit Site** and youâ€™ll be redirected to your new website.

**Note**: If the Visit Site option does not appear, you will need to force a commit in your README file. Steps on how to do this are in the README file use and work portfolio content section for adding text to documentation. Commits may take several minutes to sync.
