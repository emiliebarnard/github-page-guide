# Create a GitHub repository
A repository is a hosting location where README files written in Markdown will store your content to host as a work portfolio.
1. Select **Your account** icon on the top right and choose **Your repositories**.
2. Select **New**.

4. Select **Public**.

   **Note**: A public repository is visible to anyone on the internet. Private is only visible to you and others you share with.

Commits may take several minutes to sync.
